/**
 * Indicates a service which is aware of all {@link MetadataProvider}s in the system and
 * can provide access to their respective capabilities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link MetadataService} provides a convenient way for any object that requires metadata
 * information to consult a single source that can provide that metadata. An implementation
 * can act as the single source because it can identify which {@link MetadataProvider} is
 * applicable to a given metadata identification string and delegate to that provider.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An instance of {@link MetadataService} becomes aware of candidate {@link MetadataProvider}
 * instances by way of "registration". The {@link #register(MetadataProvider)} and
 * {@link #deregister(MetadataProvider)} methods are used for registration management.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As indicated by the {@link MetadataService} interface extending {@link MetadataCache},
 * all implementations must provide caching support. At bare minimum, an incoming request
 * to methods defined by the {@link MetadataCache} interface must be delegated through to
 * registered {@link MetadataProvider}s that also implement {@link MetadataCache}. The
 * {@link MetadataCache#evictAll()} method must be delegated to all such providers,
 * whereas {@link MetadataCache#evict(String)} need only be delegated to the provider
 * applicable for that metadata identification string (and then only if it implements
 * {@link MetadataCache}. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that a {@link MetadataService} implementation itself may elect to cache metadata. Indeed
 * it is recommended that any metadata returned by a {@link MetadataProvider} that does NOT
 * implement {@link MetadataCache} be cached directly by a {@link MetadataService}. Please
 * refer to the previous paragraph concerning mandatory delegation behaviour for provider
 * caching, which applies irrespective of whether the implementation itself performs caching.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also as indicated by {@link MetadataService} extending {@link MetadataNotificationListener},
 * an implementation is required to receive notification events and pass these notification
 * events through to the relevant {@link MetadataProvider}. If there is no registered
 * {@link MetadataProvider}, the notification method should simply return without error.
 * If passing through to a {@link MetadataProvider} that implements {@link MetadataNotificationListener},
 * any cache modification responsibilities are that of the delegate. If the {@link MetadataProvider} 
 * does not implement {@link MetadataNotificationListener}, the fallback behaviour of the
 * {@link MetadataService} implementation is to invoke {@link #get(String, boolean)}, passing a
 * true value to the evict from cache boolean parameter. It must also call
 * {@link MetadataDependencyRegistry#notifyDownstream(String)} in case any other metadata was
 * monitoring the metadata.
