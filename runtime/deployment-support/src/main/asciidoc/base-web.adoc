Web MVC Add-On
--------------

__CSS considerations__: The Web UI has been tested successfully with
FireFox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, and IE. Given that IE6 is not supported
any more by most players in the market, it has a number of severe
technical limitations and it has a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism[fast
declining user base] Spring Roo does not support IE6. Your mileage may
vary - there will likely be issues with CSS support.The Web MVC add-ons
allow you to conveniently scaffold Spring MVC controllers and JSP(X)
views for an existing domain model. Currently this domain model is
derived from the Roo supported JPA integration through the entity jpa
and related field commands. As shown in the link:#intro[Introduction]
and the link:#beginning[Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial] the Web MVC
scaffolding can deliver a fully functional Web frontend to your domain
model. The following features are included:

* Automatic update of JSPX view artifacts reflecting changes in the
domain model
* A fully customizable set JSP of tags is provided, all tags are XML
only (no tag-backing Java source code is required)
* Tags offer integration with the http://www.dojotoolkit.org/[Dojo] Ajax
toolkit for client-side validation, date pickers, tool tips, filtering
selects etc
* Automatic URL rewriting to provide best-practice RESTful URIs
* Integration of http://tiles.apache.org/[Apache Tiles] templating
framework to allow for structural customization of the Web user
interface
* Use of cascading stylesheets to allow for visual customization of the
Web user interface
* Use of Spring MVC themeing support to dynamically adjust Web user
interface by changing CSS
* Internationalization of complete Web UI is supported by simply adding
new message bundles (6+ languages are already suppprted)
* Pagination integration for large datasets
* Client- and server-side validation based on JSR 303 constraints
defined in the domain layer
* Generated controllers offer best-practice use of Spring framework MVC
support

The following sections will offer further details about available
commands to generate Web MVC artifacts and also the new JSP(X)
round-tripping model introduced in Roo 1.1.

[[controller-commands]]
Controller commands
-------------------

The Web MVC addon offers a number of commands to generate and maintain
various Web artifacts:

1.  ---------------------------
~.Person roo> web mvc setup
---------------------------
+
The first time the link:#command-index-web-mvc-setup[web mvc setup]
command is executed Roo will install all artifacts required for the Web
UI.
2.  -------------------------------------------------------------------
~.Person roo> web mvc scaffold --class com.foo.web.PersonController
-------------------------------------------------------------------
+
The controller scaffold command will create a Spring MVC controller for
the Person entity with the following method signatures:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method Signature  |Comment 
|public String **create**(@Valid Person person, BindingResult result,
ModelMap modelMap) \{..} |The create method is triggered by HTTP POST
requests to /<app-name>/people. The submitted form data will be
converted to a Person object and validated against JSR 303 constraints
(if present). Response is redirected to the show method.

|public String **createForm**(ModelMap modelMap) \{..} |The create form
method is triggered by a HTTP GET request to /<app-name>/people?form.
The resulting form will be prepopulated with a new instance of Person,
referenced Cars and datepatterns (if needed). Returns the Tiles view
name.

|public String **show**(@PathVariable("id") Long id, ModelMap modelMap)
\{..} |The show method is triggered by a HTTP GET request to
/<app-name>/people/<id>. The resulting form is populated with a Person
instance identifier by the id parameter. Returns the Tiles view name.

|public String **list**(@RequestParam(value = "page", required = false)
Integer page, @RequestParam(value = "size", required = false) Integer
size, ModelMap modelMap) \{..} |The list method is triggered by a HTTP
GET request to /<app-name>/people. This method has optional parameters
for pagination (page, size). Returns the Tiles view name.

|public String **update**(@Valid Person person, BindingResult result,
ModelMap modelMap) \{..} |The update method is triggered by a HTTP PUT
request to /<app-name/people. The submitted form data will be converted
to a Person object and validated against JSR 303 constraints (if
present). Response is redirected to the show method.

|public String **updateForm**(@PathVariable("id") Long id, ModelMap
modelMap) \{ |The update form method is triggered by a HTTP GET request
to /<app-name>/people/<id>?form. The resulting form will be prepopulated
with a Person instance identified by the id parameter, referenced Cars
and datepatterns (if needed). Returns the Tiles view name.

|public String **delete**(@PathVariable("id") Long id,
@RequestParam(value = "page", required = false) Integer page,
@RequestParam(value = "size", required = false) Integer size) \{..} |The
delete method is triggered by a HTTP DELETE request to
/<app-name>/people/<id>. This method has optional parameters for
pagination (page, size). Response is redirected to the list method.

|public Collection<Car> **populateCars**() \{..} |This method
prepopulates the 'car' attribute. This method can be adjusted to handle
larger collections in different ways (pagination, caching, etc).

|void **addDateTimeFormatPatterns**(ModelMap modelMap) \{..} |Method to
register date and time patterns used for date and time binding for form
submissions.
|=======================================================================
+
As you can see Roo implements a number of methods to offer a RESTful MVC
frontend to your domain layer. All of these methods can be found in the
PersonController_Roo_Controller.aj ITD. Feel free to push-in any (or
all) of these methods to change default behaviour implemented by Roo.
+
The link:#command-index-web-mvc-scaffold[web mvc scaffold] command
offers a number of optional attributes which let you refine the way
paths are managed and which methods should be generated in the
controller. The *--disallowedOperations* attribute helps you refine
which methods should not be generated in the scaffolded Roo controller.
If you want to prevent several methods from being generated provide a
comma-separated list (i.e.: --disallowedOperations
delete,update,create). You can also specify which methods should be
generated and which not in the PersonController.java source:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RooWebScaffold(path = "people", formBackingObject = Person.class, create = false, 
                update = false, delete = false)
@RequestMapping("/people")
@Controller
public class PersonController {}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
If you don't define a custom path Roo will use the plural representation
of the simple name of the form backing entity (in our case 'people'). If
you wish you can define more complex custom paths like /public/people or
/my/special/person/uri (try to to stick to REST patterns if you can
though). A good use case for creating controllers which map to custom
paths is security. You can, for example create two controllers for the
Person entity. One with the default path (/people) for public access
(possibly with delete, and update functionality disabled) and one for
admin access (/admin/people). This way you can easily secure the
/admin/* path with the Spring Security addon.
3.  --------------------------------
roo> web mvc all --package ~.web
--------------------------------
+
The link:#command-index-web-mvc-all[web mvc all] command provides a
convenient way to quickly generate Web MVC controllers for all JPA
entities Roo can find in your project. You need to specify the
*--package* attribute to define a package where these controllers should
be generated. While the web mvc all command is convenient, it does not
give you the same level of control compared to the
link:#command-index-web-mvc-scaffold[web mvc scaffold] command.
4.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
roo> web mvc controller --class com.foo.web.CarController --preferredMapping /public/car
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/com/foo/web/CarController.java
Created SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/public/car
Created SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/public/car/index.jspx
Managed SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties
Managed SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/menu.jspx
Created SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/public/car/views.xml
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
The web mvc controller command is different from the other two
controller commands shown above. It does _not_ generate an ITD with
update, create, delete and other methods to integrate with a specific
form backing entity. Instead, this command will create a simple
controller to help you get started for developing a custom functionality
by stubbing a simple __get__(), __post__() and __index__() method inside
the controller:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RequestMapping("/public/car/**")
@Controller
public class CarController {

    @RequestMapping
    public void get(ModelMap modelMap, HttpServletRequest request, 
                    HttpServletResponse response) {
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, value = "{id}")
    public void post(@PathVariable Long id, ModelMap modelMap, HttpServletRequest request, 
                     HttpServletResponse response) {
    }

    @RequestMapping
    public String index() {
        return "public/car/index";
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
In addition, this controller is registered in the Web MVC menu and the
application Tiles definition. Furthermore, a simple view (under
WEB-INF/views/public/car/index.jspx).
5.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
roo> web mvc finder add --class ~.web.PersonController --formBackingType ~.domain.Person
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
The link:#command-index-web-mvc-finder-add[web mvc finder add] command
used from the Roo shell will introdroduce the *@RooWebFinder* annotation
into the specified target type.
6.  -----------------------
roo> web mvc finder all
-----------------------
+
The link:#command-index-web-mvc-finder-all[web mvc finder all] command
used from the Roo shell will introdroduce the *@RooWebFinder*
annotations to all existing controllers which have a form backing type
that offers dynamic finders.

[[conversion-service]]
Application Conversion Service
------------------------------

Whenever a controller is created for the first time in an application,
Roo will also install an application-wide ConversionService and
configure it for use in webmvc-config.xml as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<mvc:annotation-driven conversion-service="applicationConversionService"/>
...
<bean id="applicationConversionService" class="com.springsource.vote.web.ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean"/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring MVC uses the ConversionService when it needs to convert between
two objects types -- e.g. Date and String. To become more familiar with
its features we recommend that you review the (brief) sections on "Type
Conversion" and "Field Formatting" in the Spring Framework
documentation.

The ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean is a Roo-managed Java class
and it looks like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RooConversionService
public class ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean extends FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean {

    @Override
    protected void installFormatters(FormatterRegistry registry) {
        super.installFormatters(registry);
        // Register application converters and formatters
    }

}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the comment indicates you can use the installFormatters() method to
register any Converters and Formatters you wish to add. In addition to
that Roo will automatically maintain an ITD with Converter registrations
for every associated entity that needs to be displayed somewhere in a
view. A typical use case is where entities from a many-to-one
association need to be displayed in one of the JSP views. Rather than
using the toString() method for that, a Converter defines the formatting
logic for how to present the associated entity as a String.

Note, a custom written or pushed in converter method needs to be
registered manually via the _installFormatters_ method which is already
present in your _ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean.java_ source
code.

In some cases you may wish to customize how a specific entity is
formatted as a String in JSP views. For example suppose we have an
entity called Vote. To customize how it is displayed in the JSP views
add a method like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RooConversionService
public class ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean extends FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean {

    // ...

    public Converter<Vote, String> getVoteConverter() {
        return new Converter<Vote, String>() {
            public String convert(Vote source) {
                return new StringBuilder().append(
                       source.getIp()).append(" ").append(source.getRegistered()).toString();
            }
        };
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point Roo will notice that the addition of the method and will
remove it from the ITD much like overriding the toString() method in a
Roo entity works.

Note, in some cases you may create a form backing entity which does not
contain any suitable fields for conversion. For example, the entity may
only contain a field indicating a relationship to another entity (i.e.
type one-to-one or one-to-many). Since Roo does not use these fields for
its generated converters it will simply omit the creation of a converter
for such form backing entities. In these cases you may have to provide
your own custom converter to convert from your entity to a suitable
String representation in order to prevent potential converter
exceptions.

[[jsp-views]]
JSP Views
---------

As mentioned in the previous section, Roo copies a number of static
artifacts into the target project after issuing the controller command
for the first time. These artifacts include Cascading Style Sheets,
images, http://tiles.apache.org/[Tiles] layout definitions, JSP files,
message property files, a complete tag library and a web.xml file. These
artifacts are arranged in different folders which is best illustrated in
the following picture:

image:images/web-project-structure.png[image]

The i18n folder contains translations of the Web UI. The
messages_XX.properties files are static resources (which will never be
adjusted after the initial installation) which contain commonly used
literals which are part of the Web UI. The application.properties file
will be managed by Roo to contain application-specific literals. New
types or fields added to the domain layer will result in new key/value
combinations being added to this file. If you wish to translate the
values generated by Roo in the application.properties file, just create
a copy of this file and rename it to application_XX.properties (where XX
represents your language abbreviation).

Roo uses XML compliant JSP files (JSPX) instead of the more common JSP
format to allow round-tripping of views based on changes in the domain
layer of your project. Not all jspx files in the target project are
managed by Roo after the initial installation (although future addons
may choose to do so). Typically jspx files in sub folders under
WEB-INF/views are maintained in addition to the menu.jspx.

Here is an example of a typical roo managed jspx file (i.e.:
WEB-INF/views/people/update.jspx):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<div xmlns:field="urn:jsptagdir:/WEB-INF/tags/form/fields" 
     xmlns:form="urn:jsptagdir:/WEB-INF/tags/form" 
     xmlns:jsp="http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page" version="2.0">
  <jsp:output omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>
    
  <form:update id="fu_com_foo_Person" modelAttribute="person" path="/people" 
               z="3lX+WZW4CQVBb7OlvB0AvdgbGRQ=">
      <field:datetime dateTimePattern="${person_birthday_date_format}" field="birthDay" 
                      id="c_com_foo_Person_birthDay" z="dXnEoWaz4rI4CKD9mlz+clbSUP4="/>
      <field:select field="car" id="c_com_foo_Person_car" itemValue="id" items="${cars}" 
                    path="/cars" z="z2LA3LvNKRO9OISmZurGjEczHkc="/>
      <field:select field="cars" id="c_com_foo_Person_cars" itemValue="id" items="${cars}" 
                    multiple="true" path="/cars" z="c0rdAISxzHsNvJPFfAmEEGz2LU4="/>
  </form:update>
</div>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will notice that this file is fairly concise compared to a normal
jsp file. This is due to the extensive use of the tag library which Roo
has installed in your project in the WEB-INF/tags folder. Each tag
offeres a number of attributes which can be used to customize the
appearance / behaviour of the tag - please use code completion in your
favourite editor to review the options or take a peek into the actual
tags.

All tags are completely self-reliant to provide their functionality
(there are no Java sources needed to implement specific behaviour of any
tag). This should make it very easy to customize the behaviour of the
default tags without any required knowledge of traditional Java JSP tag
development. You are free to customize the contents of the Roo provided
tag library to suit your own requirements. You could even offer your
customized tag library as a new addon which other Roo users could
install to replace the default Roo provided tag library.

Most tags have a few common attributes which adhere with Roo conventions
to support round-tripping of the jspx artifacts. The following rules
should be considered if you wish to customize tags or jspx files in a
Roo managed project:

* The id attribute is used by Roo to find existing elements and also to
determine message labels used as part of the tag implementation.
Changing a tag identifier will result in another element being generated
by Roo when the Roo shell is active.
* Roo provided tags are registered in the root element of the jspx
document and are assigned a namespace. You should be able to see element
and attribute code completion when using a modern IDE (i.e. SpringSource
Tool Suite)
* The z attribute represents a hash key for a given element (see a
detailed discussion of the hash key attribute in the paragraph below).

The hash key attribute is important for Roo because it helps determining
if a user has altered a Roo managed element. This is the secret to
round-trip support for JSPX files, as you can edit anything at any time
yet Roo will be able to merge in changes to the JSPX successfully. The
hash key shown in the "z" attribute is calculated as shown in the
following table:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Included in hash key calculation  |_Not_ included in hash key
calculation 
|Element name (name only, not namespace) |Namespace of element name

|Attribute names present in element |White spaces used in the element

|Attribute values present in the element |Potential child elements

| |The z key and its value

| |Any attribute (and value) whose name starts with '_'

| |The order of the attributes does not contribute to the value of a
hash key
|=======================================================================

The hash code thus allows Roo to determine if the element is in its
"original" Roo form, or if the user has modified it in some way. If a
user changes an element, the hash code will not match and this indicates
to Roo that the user has customized that specific element. Once Roo has
detected such an event, Roo will change the "z" attribute value to
"user-managed". This helps clarify to the user that Roo has adopted a
"hands off" approach to that element and it's entirely the user's
responsibility to maintain. If the user wishes for Roo to take
responsibility for the management of a "user-managed" element once
again, he or she can simply change the value of "z" to "?". When Roo
sees this, it will replace the questionmark character with a calculated
hash code. This simple mechanism allows Roo to easily round trip JSPX
files without interfering with manual changes performed by the user. It
represents a significant enhancement from Roo 1.0 where a file was
entirely user managed or entirely Roo managed.

Roo will order fields used in forms in the same sequence they appear in
the domain object. The user can freely change the sequence of form
elements without interfering with Roo's round tripping approach (Roo
will honour user chosen element sequences as long as it can detect
individual elements by their id).

The user can nest Roo managed elements in in any structure he wishes
without interfering with Roo jspx round tripping. For example elements
can be enclosed by HTML div or span tags to change visual or structural
appearance of a page.

Most default tags installed by Roo have a render attribute which is of
boolean type. This allows users to completely disable the rendering of a
given tag (and potential sub tags). This is useful in cases where you
don't wish individual fields in a form to be presented to the user but
rather have them autopopulated through other means (i.e. input
type="hidden"). The value of the render attribute can also be calculated
dynamically through the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) or normal JSP
expression language. The generated create.jspx in Roo application
demonstrates this.

*Scaffolding of JPA reference relationships*

The Roo JSP addon will read JSR 303 (bean validation API) annotations
found in a form-backing object. The following convention is applied for
the generation of create and update (and finder) forms:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Data type / JPA annotation |Scaffolded HTML Element
|String (sizeMax < 30; @Size) |Input

|String (sizeMax >=30, @Size) |Textarea

|Number (@Min, @Max, @DecimalMin & @DecimalMax are recognized) |Input

|Boolean |Checkbox

|Date / Calendar (@Future & @Past are recognized) (Spring's
@DateTimeFormat in combination with the _style_ or _pattern_ attributes
is recognized) |Input (with JS Date chooser)

|Enum / @Enumerated |Select

|@OneToOne |Select

|@ManyToMany |Select (multi-select)

|@ManyToOne |Select

|@OneToMany * |Nothing: A message is displayed explaining that this
relationship is managed from the many-side
|=======================================================================

* As mentioned above, Roo does not scaffold a HTML form element for the
'one' side of a @OneToMany relationship. To make this relationship work,
you need to provide a @ManyToOne annotated field on the opposite side:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
field set --fieldName students --type com.foo.domain.Person --class com.foo.domain.School --cardinality ONE_TO_MANY

field reference --fieldName school --type com.foo.domain.School --class com.foo.domain.Person --cardinality MANY_TO_ONE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case a field is annotated with @Pattern, the regular expression is
passed on to the tag library where it may be applied through the use of
the JS framework of choice.

*Automatic Scaffolding of dynamic finders*

Roo will attempt to scaffold Spring MVC JSP views for all dynamic
finders registered in the form backing object. This is done by using the
link:#command-index-web-mvc-finder-all[web mvc finder all] or
link:#command-index-web-mvc-finder-add[web mvc finder add] command.

Due to file name length restrictions by many file systems (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems) Roo can only
generate JSP views for finders which have 244 characters or less
(including folders). If the finder name is longer than 244 characters
Roo will silently skip the generation of jsp view artifacts for the
dynamic finder in question). More detail can be found in ticket
https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-1027[ROO-1027].
