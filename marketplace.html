##  Roo Addon Suites

The alternative to Roobot, easier to maintain and available for everyone,
a place to find and keep track on third party addons and Roo Addon Suites.

A *Roo Addon Suite* is a great way to package and distribute a set of add-ons
together, for example if you want to distribute Roo custom distributions.
Roo Addon Suite is based on OSGi R5 Subsystems that provides a really convenient
deployment model, without compromising the modularity of Roo.
