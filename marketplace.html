##  Roo Addon Suites

A place to find and keep track on third party addons and *Roo Addon Suites*,
easier to maintain and available for everyone. Spring Roo is modular,
you can install new features with the install addon command.

A *Roo Addon Suite* is a great way to package and distribute a set of add-ons
together, for example if you want to distribute Roo custom distributions.
Roo Addon Suite is based on OSGi R5 Subsystems that provides a really convenient
deployment model, without compromising the modularity of Roo.

Add-ons are the most convenient way to reuse Spring Roo code, either
commercially or free. Spring Roo page project serves as the store for the add-ons.


While DataTables has a lot of flexibility built-in by default, there might come a time when you wish to add your own features or overrule some of what DataTables does internally. This is possible through the plug-in architecture that DataTables provides for developers. This section of the DataTables site provides plug-ins of various types, which the authors have kindly released for public consumption. If you have any you would also like to share, please get in touch or send a Github pull request.
