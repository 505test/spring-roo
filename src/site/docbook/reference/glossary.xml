        <para>Roo refers to SpringSource's interactive, lightweight, user customizable
        tooling that is designed to facilitate rapid delivery of high performance
        enterprise applications written in Java. Outside the enterprise software space,
        "roo" is a common abbreviation for "kangaroo", which is a marsupial native to
        Australia (just like SpringSource's initial Roo project team).
