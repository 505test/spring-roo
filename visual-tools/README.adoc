== Spring Roo Visual Tools

As usual, Spring Roo includes shell commands for installing and
managing its features, but since Roo 2.0 a new way to interact with Roo have 
been introduced, the visual tools.

Despite Roo's really nice shell, there are features that are easier to execute
using a graphical user interface, like the management of the OSGi repositories
list or the workflow to create new projects among others.

For that reason, Spring Roo 2.0 includes graphical user tools or visual tools
that make some Roo tasks easier to execute.

This folder will contain these new visual tools.
